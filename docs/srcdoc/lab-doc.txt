bypass_dis Bypass skips the top half (lab) or bottom half (mlab) of the cells for the carry and share chains (needs BTO, resp. TTO disabled too)
tto_dis When disabled, allows carry in/share in from the lab at (x, y+1) cell 9 into local cell 0
bto_dis When disabled, allows carry in/share in from local cell 4 into local cell 5
